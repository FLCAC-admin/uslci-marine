## General Information

description: >
    This dataset represents the movement of goods via a [SHIP_TYPE] using
    [FUEL] as a fuel source.
    The reference flow is the movement of 1 metric ton of goods for a distance
    of 1 km.

# valid_until: 2023 # Assigned in code
# valid_from: 2023 # Assigned in code

time_description: >
    This process reflects the vehicle fleet as estimated in [YEAR]. 

geography_description: >
    This process assumes an average emissions rate based on a route from XX to YY.
    The route is also used to estimate the portion of emissions that occur within
    an Emissions Control Area (ECA), where reduced emissions are required. 
    Note no location object is assigned as emissions are primarily occuring in 
    open waters.
