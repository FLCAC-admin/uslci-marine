## General Information

description: >
    This dataset represents the movement of goods via a [SHIP_TYPE] using
    [FUEL] as a fuel source.
    The reference flow is the movement of a unit of mass of goods (e.g., 1 kg)
    across a distance (e.g., 1 km).
    Emissions account for vessel activity during transit, maneuvering, hotelling,
    and anchorage.

time_description: >
    This process reflects the marine fleet as estimated in [YEAR] based on vessel Entrance
    and Clearance data for U.S. ports for that year.

geography_description: >
    This process assumes an average emissions rate based on a route from [PORT] to [DESTINATION].
    The route is also used to estimate the portion of emissions that occur within
    an Emissions Control Area (ECA), where reduced emissions are required. 
    Note no location object is assigned as emissions are primarily occuring in 
    open waters.

technology_description: >
    [SHIP DESCRIPTION] This type is modeled as [Subtype] with a capacity of
    [Capacity (metric tons)] metric tons and an assumed utilization of [Utilization]%.
    Vessel characteristics are sourced from EPA Ports Emissions Inventory Guidance,
    Appendix C (USEPA 2022).

ship_description:
    # See Table 3.1 of EPA 2022
    chemical_tanker: >
        [SHIP_TYPE]s are liquid-cargo vessels that transport chemicals in bulk.

    container_ship: >
        [SHIP_TYPE]s are dry-cargo vessels that carry containerized cargo.

## LCI method

    Attributional process.

modeling_constants_description: >
    Engine kW ratings for propulsion, auxiliary and boilers were obtained from the EPA
    Ports Emisisons Inventory Guidance (USEPA 2022). For the auxiliary and boilers,
    the kW already took into account the load factor. For the propulsion a load
    factor was calculated using the well-known Propeller Law (see Equation 3.6 in
    USEPA 2022). The Propeller Law takes into account the sea margin, which is an
    efficiency factor of between [SM_COASTAL] and [SM_OPEN] for weather conditions.
    However, at lower speeds, where the load is 20% or less, emissions are increased
    due to inefficiencies. These factors were also obtained from EPA (USEPA 2022).
    For these calculations we used the adjustment for load factors <=2%.

## Data Source information

completeness_description: >
    HAP speciation profiles from USEPA 2022 (see Appendix D) are applied to VOC
    and PM emission factors.

data_selection_description: >
    Representative routes were selected using shipping lanes between the most
    frequently visited ports based on the Entrance and Clearance data for 2023
    (USACE 2023). Shipping lanes reflect the most efficient route between the
    origin and destination ports. The shipping lanes were from the Global
    Shipping Routes from ArcGIS which were originally generated from shipping
    lane vectors from the Map of the World Oceans. This analysis provided the
    typical transit distance and percentages in ECA zones.

data_treatment_description: >
    The average vessel speeds for the typical vessels are used to calculate the
    transit time by dividing the distance by speed. The average speed is calculated
    based on the mode of transit speed ratios multiplied by the max speed (USEPA 2022).

    The time for the port, maneuvering, and anchorage times also need to be estimated.
    The international port times were derived from data from median time spent in
    port by container ships worldwide in 2021, by country. The US dwell times were
    based on a US average from 2022 of 34.6 hours for container ships and 41 hours
    for tankers (BTS 2023). 

    Maneuvering time was estimated based on the distance a ship travels from the
    breakwater to the pier/wharf/dock (PWD). Average maneuvering speeds range
    between 3 to 8 knots. Outbound speeds are usually faster since the ship does
    not need to dock (Browning 2006). Because of this we assumed a speed of 
    [DEST_MANEUV_SPEED] inbound and [ORIGIN_MANEUV_SPEED] for the outbound speed.
    The distance was measured from the innermost point of the port to the coastline
    plus 0.5 miles for the breakwater. These distances were averaged by the US
    region and global regions. 

    The anchorage time was assumed to be [ANCH_TIME]% of the total transit time. This is
    based on averaging the average percentage time of anchorage from AIS tracking,
    which ranges from 4% to 9%.


sampling_description: >
    Representative routes from various global regions were selected based on the most
    frequent vessel activity.

data_collection_description: >
    Data were modeled in 2025.

use_advice: >
    Select routes are provided from various global regions to the United States.
    The choice of route primarily impacts the share of the emissions that occur
    during transit relative to near-shore emissions during maneuvering, hotelling,
    and anchorage. These processes are generally applicable to outgoing transit
    as well. This process is intended to connect to fuel supply processes in the
    USLCI.

intended_application: >
    Situation C1 - Accounting, with system-external interactions - The intended
    application is a purely descriptive accounting / documentation of the analyzed
    system including existing interactions with other systems in the LCI model.
    The target audience of this model includes LCA practitioners, industry, and
    the general public. A full inventory of environmental flows are included;
    thus this unit process can be used for a full range of LCIA impact categories.
